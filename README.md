## About

Create-UI is an tool for creating user interfaces, powered by the [Vectara Platform](https://vectara.com/).

For examples of what you'll be building, check out the following sites:

### [Ask News](https://asknews.demo.vectara.com)

### [LegalAid](https://legalaid.demo.vectara.com)

## Prerequisites

To get started, the minimum requirement is to install [npm and node](https://nodejs.org/en/download). That's it!

## Quickstart

Create-UI comes packaged with preset configurations that allow you spin up a sample application using Vectara's public datastores. To quickly get started, run the following command:

```
npx @vectara/create-ui
```

When prompted for which application to create, simply select from one of three default apps:

1. `Vectara Docs` - Answer questions about Vectara documentation
2. `Vectara.com` - Answer questions about the content of the Vectara company website
3. `AskFeynman` - Answer questions about Richard Feynman's lectures

After selecting which application to create, Create-UI will complete a short setup process. Once this process is complete, copy and run the provided commands to run the app in your browser at `http://localhost:4444`.

Congratulations! You've just setup and run a sample app powered by Vectara! We'll work on setting up a custom application later in the next section.

## Building Your Own Application

### Prerequisites

When building your own application, you will need to:

- **Create a data store:** Log into the [Vectara Console](https://console.vectara.com/) and [create a data store](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/console-ui/creating-a-corpus).
- **Add data to the data store.** You can use [Vectara Ingest](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-ingest/blob/main/README.md#quickstart) to crawl datasets and websites, or use our [Indexing APIs](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/indexing-apis/indexing) directly.

### Running Your Custom App

If you choose `Custom Application` from the application type prompt, you will be asked to provide:

- your Vectara customer ID
- the ID of the corpus you created as a prerequisite to this process
- the API key of your selected Vectara corpus (**NOTE: Depending on your set up, this may be visible to users. To ensure safe sharing, ensure that this key is set up to only have query access.**)
- any sample questions to display on the site, to get your users started.

![Custom Setup: Step 1](img/setup/custom-step-1.gif)

Once provided, the values above will go into your own customized `.env` configuration, and your site will be ready to go by running:

```
npm run start
```

## Make It Your Own!

Whether you choose to set up a preset application or build a custom app, you have the ability to make it your own.

### Modifying the UI

The UI source code is all in the `src/` sub-directory of your main project directory. You are free to make any changes to suit your unique needs.

NOTE: The UI assumes there is a metadata field called `url` for each document in your Vectara corpus. If the `url` field exists, it will be displayed with search results as a clickable URL. If it does not, the title is used instead, but it will not be clickable.

### Modifying the Proxy Server

While the app run via `npm run start` works with a local client that accesses the Vectara API directly, running the app via Docker spins up a full-stack solution, using a proxy server to make Vectara API requests.

In order to modify the request handlers, make changes to `/server/index.js`.

## Configuration

After the configuration process has created your `.env` file, you are free to make modifications to it to suit your development needs.

These variables can be set in your `.env` file, which is created during the quickstart process.
